# Adlens Worklog 
## 2021-02-07  Geert

My first version of the daily ad dump is running. The main reasons for this first version are
* First experiments with the ad library API. Limitations and possibilities
* have daily downloaded data to compare to the [Ad Library Report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/) 
* No website, API or web service yet. Just a simple daily download.

I made this in Node.js and store the data in a mongo db.
