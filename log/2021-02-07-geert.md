# Adlens Worklog 
## 2021-02-07  Geert

My first version of the daily ad dump is running. The main reasons for this first version are
* First experiments with the [Ad library API](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/). Limitations and possibilities
* have daily downloaded data to compare to the [Ad Library Report](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/) 
* No website, API or web service yet. Just a simple daily download.

I made this in Node.js and store the data in a mongo db. 
## Code
The code for this project is currently located at [github](https://github.com/darlingVandamme/AdLens).
I always find it difficult to correctly and consustently use git. Maybe with this new project, I can 
make another effort to really use Git as it should be used. 
I'm not sure if the code is visible at the moment for everybody. If you need access, just let me know.

I put Jan's list of [pageID's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QCeGpV-e5WgFJ0wZzEEcL9jb85hVhv3oohQIEDO9KSA/edit?ts=6009ae2b#gid=791844351)
in the database (collection 'pages').
 
There were some doubles in this list and some others where the pageID is still in the wrong format.

There are about 800 pages in this list. It's possible to include 10 ID's in a single request, 
but if one pageID is wrong, the whole request fails.
Making a new request for every page is possible, but if I make 800 requests almost at the same time, I'm over quota and all requests fail.

The current setup is that I read a batch of 150 pageID's, make a call to the API for every single pageID. 
If there are more than 50 ads, I need to do extra requests (paging).
This script is currently setup to run every hour.
In the database, every pageID keeps track of the latest API check so that I only check every page once every 24h

Single page info:
> {  
    "_id": {  
        "$oid": "601e94c04fc1afedf63db159"  
    },  
    "Disclaimer": "Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie",  
    "pageID": "334361224413",  
    "name": "N-VA",  
    "count": 39,  
    "error": null,  
    "lastCheck": {  
        "$numberLong": "1612701325131"  
    },  
    "status": 1  
}  

If you want to try out the script yourself
* install node, npm and mongoDB
* make a database 'adlens' in your local mongo
* import the pageID's (db/pages.json)
* copy file source/node/settings/private_alt.json to source/node/settings/private.json and fill in the necessary keys and passwords

I used this approach so that I can upload all my source code to git without revealing any secret keys or passwords. 
(I'm quite happy with this setup)
You can run the script in development mode or production mode (export NODE_ENV="production")
De development settings are the default and are overwritten by the production settings if necessary.

In linux the script can be run with bin/dailyGet.sh

## Database
In development mode, the script uses the database at localhost. In production mode, it uses the db that's reachable for everyone.
At the moment, I setup an mongo Atlas cluster DB under my own account.       
https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/601ea4356e393d5cd15f3568#clusters
If you want access to check out the data or if you want to learn mongoDB, just ask me for a password.
The cloud database is free up till 512MB (2.2MB used at the moment) 

At the moment the script saves the ad data in 2 formats. In collection 'ads' I save the data as it returns from the API.
I only add a timestamp. A single ad can be in this collection multiple times. 
The data is also saved in collection 'adsEvol'. In this collection I keep the ads unique, but keep additional info about the fields that change over time.
(Impressions, reach, spending )
With a simple database command we can find which ads gradually grow (both in spending as in impressions)
